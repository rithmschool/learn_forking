# learn_how_to_fork
A repository to learn how to fork

Just click the button, apparently. The fun stuff comes after.
For some reason I imagined pull would be the opposite of push.
I thought that pull might be updating the forked repository
or the local clone of that repository.
But I suppose that language would be contributor biased, 
and not from the perspective of the repository.
